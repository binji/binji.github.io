    <p>Earlier this year, I was contacted on Twitter by the GOTO Stockholm organizer.
He had seen my talk at FullStackFest, and asked if I'd like to give a talk
about WebAssembly. I haven't given too many talks, but I always find it to be a
fun experience. Because I'm relatively inexperienced speaker, I treat each talk
as an experiment and try to do something new for each one. Usually a new topic,
but also a new demo or a new way of doing my slides. It often becomes my
primary non-work project, but the difference is that it has a hard deadline,
where most of my non-work projects I can just drop and no one cares (or even
knows.)</p>
<p>The theme of the event was &quot;Post-JavaScript&quot;, so having a WebAssembly talk
makes sense. This doesn't mean that WebAssembly will rise triumphant from
JavaScript's destruction, but more that WebAssembly was born to meet demands
that JavaScript was struggling to provide. Anyway, the theme of my talk was
open otherwise, so I started to consider what I wanted to talk about. I'd only
have thirty minutes, so I wouldn't be able to go into too much detail.</p>
<p>I noticed that many people were giving WebAssembly talks, and they were
answering similar questions: What is WebAssembly? What is it for? Why would you
use it over JavaScript? What makes it different from JavaScript? I figured I
would give a talk that was slightly different, focusing on how WebAssembly
enables new languages to be run on the web platform.</p>
<p>At the same time, I started thinking about what would make this talk different.
At first I thought I would do a live-coding demo of WebAssembly. I've always
wanted to do some live-coding as part of a talk, and I think with the right
demo framework it could be pretty cool. I started working on cleaning up the
wabt wast2wasm demo, which converts from WebAssembly text format to WebAssembly
binary format. I thought it would be pretty cool if you could write
WebAssembly, convert it to binary form, and run it as a software fragment
shader: the function you wrote would be run for each pixel of a canvas and
determine its color. This didn't really fit with my chosen theme, though, so I
shelved the idea.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to borrow an idea -- funny because I wanted my talk to be
different -- to use a hand-drawn cartoon style. I really enjoyed the look of
Lin Clark's &quot;A Cartoon Intro to WebAssembly,&quot; but I'm not a very skilled
artist. But I can trace pictures; would that look good?</p>
<p>I worked on a quick experiment using the WebAssembly logo:</p>
<p>First, I loaded the image in GIMP:</p>
<p>Then I created a new layer, reduced the opacity of the other layer, and started
tracing over it:</p>
<p>Then I created another layer and did it again:</p>
<p>Finally, I removed the original image layer and used the GIMP export GIF
feature to generate an animation from layers:</p>
